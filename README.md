<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    ENTHIRAN is an autonomous line-following robot that can detect and follow a black line on a white surface. Designed with an Arduino Uno, IR sensors, and motor control, this project explores core concepts of automation, robotics, and sensor integration. The robot leverages a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller to make real-time adjustments to stay on track, illustrating principles of control systems and feedback mechanisms.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
    The primary goal of the project is to design a robot that can autonomously follow a predefined path using IR sensors and motor control. This project serves as a practical exercise to enhance understanding of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Automation</li>
    <li>Sensor integration</li>
    <li>Control systems</li>
    <li>Industrial applications of robotics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Components</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>L29810 H Bridge Driver:</strong> Controls motor speed and direction.</li>
    <li><strong>8-array IR Sensors:</strong> Detect the black line, enabling the robot to adjust its movements.</li>
    <li><strong>Arduino Uno:</strong> Processes sensor input and controls the motors.</li>
    <li><strong>Yellow Motors and Wheels:</strong> Provides movement.</li>
    <li><strong>Swivel Caster Wheel:</strong> Ensures smooth navigation.</li>
    <li><strong>3.7V Batteries:</strong> Powers the robot for extended operations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
<p>
    We faced challenges related to sensor calibration, power management, and design stability. Through iterative testing and adjustments—like switching from 4 wheels to 2 with a caster wheel, and using a calibration system for sensor thresholding—we improved the robot’s performance and stability.

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>
    The source code for the robot’s operation is provided in the repository. It includes sensor calibration, motor control, and PD-based line-following logic.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    This project demonstrates the foundational concepts of robotics and control systems, with potential applications in industrial automation, smart transportation, and more. Despite budget constraints, our creative solutions like using popsicle sticks for the chassis show how innovation can arise from resourcefulness.
